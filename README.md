# PerTract
Tootls to extract, specify, and simulate performance models of big data systems for performance prediction (e.g., response time, CPU utilization).

PerTract consists of the following repositories:

## [PerTract DSL](https://github.com/johanneskross/pertract-dsl)
Domain Specific Language (DSL) to model big data systems

## [PerTract DSL Extraction](https://github.com/johanneskross/pertract-dsl-extraction)
Extract PerTract-DSL instances from big data frameworks (e.g., Spark, Flink, ...)

## [PerTract DSL Simulation](https://github.com/johanneskross/pertract-dsl-simulation)
Simulate PerTract-DSL instances

## [PerTract Monitoring Agent](https://github.com/johanneskross/pertract-monitoring-agent)
A lightweight agent for Java applications to sample CPU traces. We use the traces to derive resource profiles within PerTract-DSL instances
